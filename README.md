# Modern Layouts

Modern layouts strengthen skills in thinking of complex grid layouts with a responsive nature. I used various native CSS Grid techniques. `The ASCII-Art Method` and `the Named grid line technique` tempted me to develop around **50 modern layouts**. In fact, I wrote a dedicated article for the [ASCII-Art Method](https://css-tricks.com/using-grid-named-areas-to-visualize-and-reference-your-layout/) at CSS-TRICKS (It received significant attention from fellow developers and was even featured as "POPULAR OF THE MONTH).
